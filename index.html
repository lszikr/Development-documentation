			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>This web design proposal aims to support and promote the chosen Australian charity and NGO: Conservation volunteers Australia, assisting the organisation to awaken individuals consciousness and take more awareness of the current causes to our environment. With the unification of all possible enthusiastic audiences being attracted to this event, we would really appreciate and encourage them to participate the campaign and therefore illuminate the light with us.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>For me as a successful Junior Web Designer at DesCo, I need to ensure our project is well incorporated with the exisiting website. Not only to fufill the user needs based on their motivations, and also take responsibilities of all the stakeholders and maximise the potential benefits. From what I have investigated, Conservation Volunteers had made a great number of contributions which could excite and engage the users. <em>'Conservation Volunteers was founded when discussion of environmental issues was fresh, vibrant and a touch radical. It was also a ‘different world’ from today: more Australians had a connection to the land; young people anticipated a career for life; private transport was less available; inbound tourism was in its infancy.'</em> <br> <br> User needs can be intriged by evoking a sense of compassion, <strong>"on the individual level, this mechanism posits that individuals enjoy helping per se and therefore do not need any external rewards, suchas material compensation or reciprocation, to beneﬁt fromthe action emotionally (Meier & Stutzer, 2004)</strong>. <br><br>In conclusion, donation also plays an important role in this mechanism, <strong>"motives of gift giving being either altruistic (maximising the pleasure of the recipient, or agnoistic(maximising the donor's personal satisfaction)"(Sherry, 1988). </strong></p>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>There are no limitations to the audience as it is a complete non-profit public welfare organisation, anyone who is excited in this event is welcome to participate and will get attracted to this earth protection event. We don't intend to force anyone to join, it is a spontaneous collaborative activity which we offer you the opportunity to you online. The main targeted group here is mainly teenagers who are interested to get benefits from it and eventually everyone will obtain the joyfulness, love and compassion and all other forms of abundance. With some of the middle aged and elderly people who are fascinated to include themselves and maybe share a little portion of their accumulated money to help in the acquisition of tools. </p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>The ideation process was accomplished with multiple refinements. The concepts are firstly drawn into low fidelity sketches. The icons and layout were brainstormed and roughly created to present a visualisation to illustrate the potential forms of how the website may look like. Then the method of using wireframes enables me to transform imaginated construction into a more refined and transit to a higher fidelity prototype. Then it finishes and exceed a final version of web design with mockups. </p>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Mood boards are integrated into a collection of gallaries, it aims to present the beauty of nature with hopeness and vitality. Adding a sense of connection between users and the wildlifes.</p>

			<p>The homepage is designed with simple and clean layout which manages all the accessible and interative content straight into eyes. Some interesting features I have adapted here is changing the donation button to a two-way benificial term. This would not affect the experience of users while browsing the site, thus enhances the favourability of users to the website, not reminding them to donate. This would evoke their curiosity and explore themselves of the interesting features.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="fidelity/IMG_1490.JPG" alt="sample" width="100%">
          <p>There are extra interactive features to be implemented. Such that the tree grows after people successfully donated. Also, the donation icon may appear randomly on page and display as a gift onside.

          With more pages to diplay, the more functions users could discover.

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>The website design seeks for a transcend over the existing styles. I planned to incorporate both western minimalist style with the concept of <em>Avenue to Jane<em> and apply them to be modern in achievement. </p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="images/1.png" alt="sample" width="100%">
			<p>Wireframes were refined and constructed based on the low fidelity sketches. They are clear in visual, ease to use and the relative images and texts are layout in a balanced way. </p>

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>Mockup is the final testing stage before the website can be put in use. The colours I plan to use is mainly in green (symbolises natural and heart) with a portion of blue (symbolises the ocean and water) and reds to embellish the website and show the eternity of phoenix and rebirth of the earth and human.</p>
